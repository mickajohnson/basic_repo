I went to github.com and logged in.
I clicked New Repository, named it basic_repo, and clicked create repository
On my command line:
	cd desktop
	mkdir basic_repo
	cd basic_repo
	git init
	touch repo_prac.html steps.txt
I typed some content into both files
	git add .
	git commit -m "Added repo_prac and steps"
	git remote add origin https://github.com/mickajohnson/basic_repo.git
	git push -u origin master
I went to github, to see if everything worked (it did)
I changed the text in steps.txt
